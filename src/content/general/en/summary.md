Frontend engineer with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web APIs, TypeScript, React, Vue, PIXI.js Node.js, MongoDB and other technologies. Always strive to learn new skills: for the sake of personal interest or for a new work project.

I believe that the product and fundamental knowledge are primary, and specific tools like frameworks, libraries etc., can be studied and applied to appropriate tasks.

I am a team player who could efficiently communicate inside a team, across company departments or with clients.

Passionate about diving deep into complex projects and making them better, crafting accessible user-friendly interfaces, performance optimisations and delivering high-quality products.
